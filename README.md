# DigitalDash

Volvo 240 Digital Dash Project.  Designed to use existing dash connectors (circular connectors w/ 2mm pins, vehicle speed sensor (VSS) connector, and various spade connectors) to
minimize extra wiring effort and installation of superfluous sensors.

## Features
### Plug and play with stock sensors and dash connectors
One of the main goals of the project was to use the existing Volvo 240 connectors. The only additional connectors and wiring needed are for sensors that weren't available on the stock main dash (oil pressure, oil temperature, vacuum/boost pressure, etc). Dash lights (low oil pressure, battery voltage, parking brake,high beams, etc) are functional as well as turn indicators. Fuel level and coolant temperature are functional.
The hardware supports the addition of common accessory sensors such as oil pressure, oil temperature, manifold absolute pressure, and ambient temperature.

### Multiple dash styles
Different Volvo dash styles can be displayed:
#### 240 w/ Tach

### Accessory Gauges
The raspberry pi 4 supports 2 HDMI outputs so a second screen can be added where normal 52mm accessory gauges would have been placed:

## Project Structure:
### /QtDash

This directory contains the hardware and software components that makeup the dash. There are also various visual/graphical assets that are used in the dash app.

#### /QtDash/VolvoDigitalDashModels

This directory contains the Qt app and related unit tests.  It is advised to use [QtCreator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools) to edit and compile the app. Using QtCreator to `QtDash/VolvoDigitalDashModels/subdirs.pro` will load both the app and the unit tests. The app is written using C/C++ for interfacing with the various sensors and QML for the UI.

#### /QtDash/Hardware

This directory contains the hardware that has been designed for this project.  Most of the PCBs have been designed using Eagle 7.7 as this is what I am most familiar with. The future of Eagle is questionable as an open source/free tool, so Kicad 6 will be used more and more as I become more familiar with it.

##### /QtDash/Hardware/DashHat

This directory contains the schematics and board files for the PCB that directly interfaces with the Raspberry Pi 40 pin header.  The board is split up into a low voltage (3.3/5V) that is powered from the Pi header and a high voltage (car battery voltage 8-16V) that is powered from the 240 ignition switch via the VSS connector.  The high voltage side is optically isolated from the low voltage side using optoislators.

##### /QtDash/Hardware/Cold Start Power Supply

This directory contains the schematics and board files for the cold start tolerant power supply design based around the LM3488. The input range is ~3V-24V and the output is ~5V rated at 3A.  During bench testing the input power needs to be above 5V when first powering up, and then could drop to ~3V while still continuously powering the Pi. This is a little overkill as the battery voltage during cranking only momentarily drops to 3V-4V before recovering very quickly to >10V.

##### /QtDash/Hardware/Screen Mounting

This directory contains the `.stl` files for mounting the HSD123KPW2-D10 12.3" TFT LCD using the stock 240 dash mounting holes.  These mounts will put the screen flush with the surrounding dash. The mounts and all other 3D modeling/CAD has been done using [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a41976d465f773bfdcbe5a50/w/2aee2fa256d8f08e0c531410/e/f563da56c6a88e94f86205e9). Included in the public OnShape document are models of the main PCB, HSD123KPW2-D10 LCD, screen mounts, etc.

##### /QtDash/Hardware/Simulation

This directory contains SPICE simulations of various circuits used in the dash. This is more of a scratchpad than it is a serious attempt at accurate real-life simulations.

##### /QtDash/Hardware/TachAdapter

This directory contains the schematics and board files for the tach signal adapter.  This board takes the high voltage pulses (>30V on my 88 245) and converts them to a square wave that can be used by the dash software to calculate RPM. The high voltage pulses are optically isolated from the dash/pi side to prevent any unwanted noise or damage to the pi or other hardware.

##### /QtDash/Hardware/VSS Adapter

This directory contains the schematics and board files for the VSS signal adapter. This board is based on the MAX9924 VR signal conditioning IC and takes the VR signal from the stock Volvo differential cover sensor and converts it into a square wave to be used by the dash software to calculated speed.

### /buildroot

This directory contains Buildroot, a tool used to generate a custom embedded Linux system that runs on the Pi. Buildroot allows us to generate a stripped down Linux system that has just enough to get the dash running.  This is the directory where you'll need to be to start linux image builds.

Below are relevant directories for this project within the buildroot directory structure:

#### /buildroot/board/volvodash

This directory contains the rootfs overlay for the dash as well as the custom scripts and configurations used whilst building the dash linux image. 

#### /buildroot/configs

This directory contains the configuration files for various boards. The relevant files for this project are `volvodash_defconfig` and `volvodash_rpi4_defconfig`.

#### /buildroot/output/images

This directory contains the outputs of the buildroot compilation process. After buildroot is done compiling the custom linux image, compiling the specified target packages, and constructing the target rootfs and bootfs, an image that can be flashed on to an SD card is placed here.  `sdcard.img` can then be flashed on to an SD card to be used on a pi.  As a part of the compilation/building the Qt Dash app should be compiled and placed within this image.  For more detailed information see *Setting Up Buildroot* below.

## Setting up buildroot

Buildroot will build the custom linux image.  The image being build is based on the raspberry-piX 32-bit images provided from the buildroot project.  Right now there is only support for raspberry pi 3 and pi 4/400.  Things are still a bit of a mess here and depending on your flavor of Linux you might have to setup your system a little differently than others.  You can find a lot of good information here on host packages that are absolutely necessary: [Buildroot System Requirements](https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#requirement)

Detailed instructions for setting up a virtual machine and the build environment are found [here](SetupBuildEnv.md)

## Remote Access

1. SSH (ethernet)

After boot the pi will be configured with a static ip address of 192.168.42.2.
Assuming you're running a version of linux that has network-manager you can run some variation of the following after connecting the pi to your computer with an ethernet cable:

`nmcli con add con-name dash-target type ethernet ifname <your-ethernet-interface> ip4 192.168.42.1/24`

`nmcli con up id dash-target`

You can find your ethernet interface by running:

`ip addr show`

You're looking for something like `enp2s0` or `eth0` depending on your flavor of linux.

After setting everything up you can test the connection using:

`ping 192.168.42.2` 

on the host machine and then run:

`ssh root@192.168.42.2` 

and enter the default credentials

## Dash Configuration

After linux is done booting and loading kernel modules, the init system will automatically start the Qt app stored in the /opt directory.  When the app is initializing it will load two configuration files from the /opt directory:

- config.ini
- config_gauges.ini
- config_odo.ini
- config_can.ini

These files are parsed using QSettings ([more info here](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsettings.html)).

### Sensor input configuration (config.ini)

```

#### Resistive Sensor Configuration

An array of resistive sensor configurations. Calibration values can be interpolated (not advised unless a lot of data points are available) or can be fitted with a polynomial of an arbitray order.  Usually a 2nd order polynomial is good enough.  The following parameters can be configured:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| *type* | Sensor type.  Options are "coolant", "oil", and "ambient" |
| *fit* | Type of fit. Options are "interpolate" or "polynomial, N" with N as the polynomial order.

| *r* | Calibration resistance values.|
| *y* | Calibration y values |
| *units* | Units of calibration y values |
| *lag* | Lag factor (0-1).  Used to filter values with the difference equation: **y[n] = lag \* x[n] + (1 - lag) \* y[n-1]** Default value is 1.0. |
|*lag_decay*| Lag decay factor.  If set to a non-zero value the following equation will dictate the lag factor value used above: **lagStart=1-*lag*, lag[n] = lagStart \* (1 - *lag_decay*)^(n)** and saturates at the value set by *lag*. Large values will decay quickly, small values slowly.  Default value is 0.0.  |

The default configuration is designed for a VDO 360-028 Oil pressure sender and a 240-33Ohm Volvo 240 Fuel level sender.

#### Analog 12V inputs.

To measure signals that are inherently tied to battery voltage there are 2 linearized opto-isolated inputs.  The following parameters can be configured:


| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| *name* | Sensor name.  "voltmeter" is the only one currently used |
| *opto_r1* | Isolated side (R59 in schematic below) |
| *opto_r2* | Opto-isolator gain resistor R2 (R62 in schematic below) |
| *input_r1* | High side resistor of voltage divider for input into opto-isolator. (R71 in schematic below) |
| *input_r2* | Low side resistor of voltage divivider for input into opto-isolator. (R72 in schematic below) |
| *k3* | Opto-isolator K3 gain (defined by linearized opto-isolator used and will have to be measured) |
| *offset* | Offset to voltage calculation, the linearized opto-isolator usually has an offset that will need to be accounted for. |
| *x* | Linearized opto-isolator input voltage calibration measurements.  This is the high voltage side.  The more measurement points the better.   |
| *y* | Output voltage calibration measurements.  This is the low voltage side.  Ideally if there was zero offset and a K3 gain of 1.0 these should be x / 10.  This is unlikely to be the case given the binning of the IL300 and LOC11x series. |

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitfijs-jw/Volvo240-DigitalDash/674c8c60d166528e17125b2d5b143e245dce94cc/QtDash/analog-iso-12v-input.png)

##### How to determine K3 value (still need to test on car -- likely to change)
1. In the config.ini file, set *opto_r1*, *opto_r2*, *input_r1*, *input_r2*, and *k3* to 1.0.
2. In the config.ini file, set *offset* to 0.0.
3. Reboot the dash.
4. The output for the voltmeters will now be the real input to the ADC. Usually between 1V-2V for inputs from 8V to 16V.
5. With the car on but not running, measure the voltage at fuse 8.  This will be your first x value.  Take the output of the voltmeter (somewhere between 1V-2V).  This will be your first y value.
6. Start the car and repeat the above step.  These will be your second x and y values.
7. Enter the values determined above in the config.ini file.
8. Reset the *opto_r1*, *opto_r2*, *input_r1*, *input_r2* to their previous values.  You can leave *offset* and *k3* alone.  The software will use your calibration values to calculate the k3 gain and offset.
9. Reboot the dash and verify that the voltages with the car on and running match what you had measured before.

*Note on K3 gain calibration values:*
*Ideally, you would want way more than just 2 points to calibrate with.  If you have access to an adjustable power supply it is recommended to take 5+ measurements from 8V-16V.*

```

#### Tach Input Configuration

RPM is estimated by measuring the time difference between pulses from the negative terminal of the ignition coil.  The following parameters can be configured:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| *pulse_per_rot* | Number of tach pulses per rotation (number of cylinders / 2) |
| *max_rpm* | Maximum RPM to resolve.  This should be as low as possible. |
| *avg_num_samples* | Number of samples to average over to estimate RPM |

The default configuration is as follows:

```
[tach_input]
pulse_per_rot=2
max_rpm=9000
avg_num_samples=4
```

#### Vehicle speed sensor input

Designed to used the stock 240 diff cover VSS. The vehicle speed can be estimated using the number of pulses coming from the VSS sensor for every rotation of the rear diff. The following parameters can be configured:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| *pulse_per_rot* | Number of VSS pulses per rotation (12 for non-ABS and 48 for ABS equipped 240s) |
| *tire_diameter* | Tire diameter (can be used to calculate pulses per unit distance) |
| *diameter_units* | Tire diameter units: "inch", "centimeter", "millimeter", "foot", etc  |
| *pulse_per_unit_distance* | Number of pulses per units distance.   |
| *distance_units* | Distance units for pulses per unit distance:  "mile", "kilometer  |
| *max_speed* | max speed (distance_units / hour).  Keep as low as possible to avoid picking up noise as VSS pulses |

The default configuration is as follows:

```
[vss_input]
pulse_per_rot=12
tire_diameter=24.9
diameter_units="inch"
pulse_per_unit_distance=9720
distance_units="mile"
max_speed="185"
```

#### Backlight control configuration (optional and only somewhat functional)

The stock 240 dimming circuit (Pin 10 on the circular Volvo connector 31) can be used to dim the backlight of the LCD by injecting a PWM signal into the LCD control board. Back light control with the dimmer knob only works when the headlights or running lights are engaged.  Otherwise, the dimmer rheostat does not receive voltage.

The following parameters can be configured:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| *max_duty_cycle* | Maximimum duty cycle of backlight PWM signal (min_duty_cycle-1.0) |
| *min_duty_cycle* | Minimum duty cycle of backlight PWM signal (0-max_duty_cycle) |
| *lights_off_duty_cycle* | Default duty cycle to use when the headlights or running lights are off |
| *lights_on_duty_cycle* | Default duty cycle to use when headlights or running lights are on|

| *max_dimmer_ratio* | rheostat voltage as a percentage of battery voltage at brightest setting |
| *use_dimmer* | flag to use/don't use dimmer |
| *active_low* | PWM signal active low flag |

The default configuration is as follows:

```
[backlight]
max_duty_cycle=1.0
min_duty_cycle=0.05
lights_off_duty_cycle=1.0
lights_on_duty_cycle=0.5
min_dimmer_ratio=0.82
max_dimmer_ratio=0.93
use_dimmer=0
active_low=1
```

### Gauge Configs (config_gauges.ini)
There are a few options in setting up the gauge units and high/low warning indications.  There settings are found within the file config_gauges.ini.  The app will parse this file and will set the various gauge units, min/max values, and high/low warnings.

#### Gauge Config Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
|---|---|
|*units*| Gauge Display Units ||
|*low_alarm*| Value below which gauge will indicate a warning ||
|*high_alarm*| Value above which gauge will indicate a warning ||
|*alt_units_enable*| Enable alternate units|*false*|
|*alt_units*|Alternate units|\"\"|
|*alt_units_thres*|Threshold value to switch units|*0.0*|
|*alt_units_above*|If true, use alternate units above threshold.  Otherwise the alternate units are used below the threshold|*false*|

##### Example:
This example sets the units for coolant temperature gauges, in all screens, to celsius.  The gauge will indicate an alarm when the temperature exceeds 100C.
```
[coolant_temp]
units="C"
low_alarm=0.0
high_alarm=100.0
```

#### Available Gauge Units
Below are the available units for each gauge type

| Gauge Type | Available Units |
|---|---|
|**[boost]**|```"bar"``` ```"psi"``` ```"inHg"```|
|**[coolant_temp]**|```"C"``` ```"F"```|
|**[fuel_level]**|```"%"```|
|**[oil_pressure]**|```"bar"``` ```"psi"```|
|**[oil_temperature]**|```"C"``` ```"F"```|
|**[voltmeter]**|```"V"```|
|**[speedo]**|```"mph"``` ```"kph"``` ```"km/h"```|
|**[tacho]**|*none*|

#### Default Gauge Ranges

These are the default gauge ranges for the given units.  These can be assigned to different values in *config_gauges.ini*, but the gauges themselves are prerendered so its not gauranteed that the needle position will align with the displayed value

| Gauge Type | Unit | Min Value | Max Value |
|---|---|---|---|
|**[boost]**| ```"psi"``` | -20 | 30 |
|**[boost]**| ```"bar"```| -1.0| 1.5 |
|**[coolant_temp]**| ```"C"``` | 50 | 120 |
|**[coolant_temp]**| ```"F"```| 120| 250 |
|**[fuel_level]**| ```"%"``` | 0 | 100 |
|**[oil_pressure]**| ```"bar"```| 0| 5 |
|**[oil_pressure]**| ```"psi"``` | 0 | 80 |
|**[oil_temperature]**| ```"C"```| 50| 150 |
|**[oil_temperature]**| ```"F"``` | 120 | 300 |
|**[voltmeter]**| ```"V"```| 10| 16 |
|**[speedo]**| ```"kph"``` ```"km/h"``` | 0 | 220 |
|**[speedo]**| ```"mph"```| 0| 120 |

### CAN config (config_can.ini)
Rev C hardware added components to interface with CAN outputs from an aftermarket ECU.  The MCP2515 driver and can0 network interface are loaded when the dash boots and the Dash Qt app attempts to load CAN frame configuration from the *config_can.ini* file.  To date this has only been tested with a Microsquirt on a bench with simulated inputs. If the CAN interface is enabled in the CAN config file, the dash will preferentially use the frame data for a specific gauge over a hardware sensor.

#### Enable/Disable
Under the **[start]** heading in the CAN config file, there is a single option:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| *use* | true/false to enable/disable the use of incoming CAN data |

#### CAN Frame data
Under the **[can_frame]** heading will come the CAN frame data settings. This is setup based upon information found [here](http://www.msextra.com/doc/pdf/Megasquirt_CAN_Broadcast.pdf).

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| *frame_id* | CAN Frame ID where data is present |
| *offset* | Offset within frame where the data is present |
| *data_size* | Data size in bytes |
| *signed* | true if data is signed |
| *name* | Name of data (map, rpm, tps, etc) -- default values come from the simplified CAN broadcast data from Megasquirt |
| *units* | Units of data |
| *multiply* | Factor to multiply raw value by |
| *divide* | Factor to divide raw value by |
| *add* | Value to add to raw value |
| *gauge* | Gauge to route data to. |

Order of operations is **(raw_data * multiply_factor / divide_factor) + add_value**.  Is this right? No idea.

```
